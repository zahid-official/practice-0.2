# What is JS?

JavaScript is a programming language that has been widely used in the tech industry for over a decade. When we think of programming languages, names like **Java**, **C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **Ruby** usually come to mind. These are mostly backend programming languages. JavaScript is the only programming language that was originally built for frontend development. That’s why, whenever we talk about web development, JavaScript is always mentioned alongside HTML and CSS.

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It responds to user actions, allowing us to manipulate HTML and CSS based on those actions. Using JavaScript, we can update content, handle user input, and even create animations without reloading the page.

One of JavaScript’s core strengths is that it can directly interact with the DOM, which represents the structure of a web page. This means we can easily change a webpage’s style, content, or structure dynamically using JavaScript. On top of that, it's great for tasks like data storage, processing, complex calculations, and form validation.

In modern web development, JavaScript is no longer limited to just the frontend. With the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now run outside the browser too. That means both frontend and backend code can be written in JavaScript, making it easier to build full-stack web applications.

Beyond web development, JavaScript has grown into many other areas. Thanks to tools like React Native and Cordova, it’s used for mobile app development. With Electron, we can build desktop apps as well.

In short, JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic for users. While it started in the browser, it’s now used to build a wide variety of applications across platforms.
